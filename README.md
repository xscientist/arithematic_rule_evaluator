# Arithematic Rule Evaluator
The purposse of this small project was a simple engine that could process and evaluate basic arithematic string.

## Getting Started
Pretend you have an infix arithematic rule of format "A + B + C- D = 0", and you have been given with the values for A, B, C and D respectively as 4,6,3 and 13. Or any other rule of the similar format that you want, for a simple rule engine that could do your simple stuff, then you are at the write place. 
The approach used is to move any defined infix rule to postfix, place values in place of the parameters and then evaluate them.

### Prerequisites
You'll need python for running this, plus
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the file
```
python sample_rule_engine.py
```
